### Types of binary trees :
* rooted binary tree - every node has at most 2 children
* full(strict) binary tree - every node has either 0 or 2 children
  - In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
  - L = I + 1
  - Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes
* perfect binary tree - all interior nodes have 2 children and all leaves have same depth/level.
  - A Perfect Binary Tree of height h has 2^(h) â€“ 1 node.
