# Data-Structures

## Stack :

* Stack is a linear data structure which allows elements to be inserted as well as deleted only from one end.
* LIFO data structure i.e last in first out
* Stack code:
1) stack implementation using array
## trees - are hierarchical data structures.

* Binary tree-A tree whose elements have at most 2 children
* bt properties:
1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^(l-1).
2. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^(h) – 1.
### Tree traversals:
1. dft:
- inorder
- preorder
- postorder
2. bft:
- level order traversal
## Time complexity for all the above traversal-o(n)
